This is a project from the course "Principles of object oriented" I have taken in my first year in Ben Gurion University.
It is a collaboration with Tsuri Farhana, we both contributed for this project.
The main goal was to practice visitor pattern and a console - gui interface.
This project is about making a DnD style game 1 user can play.
